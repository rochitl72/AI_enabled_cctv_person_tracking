# AI Enabled CCTV Person Tracking

This repository contains two projects focused on AI-powered person tracking and surveillance:

## 1. Multi-Person ID Tracking
- Implements real-time multi-person tracking using YOLOv8, DeepSORT, and InsightFace.
- Tracks individuals across multiple frames and assigns persistent IDs.
- Uses face recognition and clothing color detection for re-identification.
- Refer to the `multi_person_id_tracking/README.md` for more details.

## 2. Suspicious Person Detection
- Detects and flags individuals based on pre-defined suspicious behavior.
- Uses AI models to identify unusual activity patterns in video feeds.
- Logs and highlights detected events for further review.
- Refer to the `suspicious_person_detect/README.md` for more details.

Each project has its own detailed README file inside its respective directory.
